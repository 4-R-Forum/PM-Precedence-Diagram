Aras PM Precedence Diagram

	
Release Notes

v11SP9   10/27/2017 First Public Release for this version of Aras Innovator.

This package creates a Report which shows a precedence diagram for a selected Project Item. The diagram provides a compact and exact graphical view of precedence in the Project in SVG format, and is an essential tool for troubleshooting scheduling issues. SVG is generated by a third party Open Source tool available under the Eclipse License from GraphViz.org. It is necessary to download and install GraphViz on the Aras Innovator server. Graphviz and prior versions of this package have been in production at Motorola for 10 years. This version uses an aspx file in the client/scripts folder which displays svg created by a Method name passed in the query string. The file needs to be in this location to avoid cross page scripting errors. Layout of the diagram can be modified using the "dot" language created in SQL and processed by the GraphViz console application. The dot language is described in the documentation at GraphViz.org.
	
Known issues
	1001) Pan and Zoom in the diagram could be more convenient
	1002) Printing the diagram in multiple pages would be desireable. It is possible to get the svg using native browser devloper tools, MS Visio opens svg files and can print on multiple pages.
	Please create any issues in GitHub
